# Learning goal

- Describe the general information contained in packet headers and the role of this information

#### A.IPv4
- Describe IP protocol header and the purpose of the fields.
- Understand how and why the IPv6 header is different from IPv4
- Explain how organizations gets IP addresses for its use.
- Define what is meant by a non-routable IP address.
- Describe the structure of IPv4 addresses and the CIDR addressing, masks for assigning the network/host
- Given a CIDR address determine the range of IP addresses it covers.
- Given a range of addresses determine an appropriate CIDR representation
- Describe the relationship between IP addresses and routing in the Internet
- Perform longest prefix matching
- Given a router, its routing tables and an incoming packet determine the link the packet will go out on
- Given a collection of routers, their routing tables, and a packet trace the packet through the network

###  IPv4 Datagram Format

![alt](./images/IPv4-Header.png)

#### Version number
- 4 bits specify the IP protocol version of the datagram
- **Router** determine how to **interpret** the remainder of OP datagram by this

#### Header length
- 4 bits
- Determine where in the **IP datagram** the payload **actually begin**

#### Type of service
- TOS were included in IPv4 header
- Allow different type of IP datagram to be distinguished from each other
(eg distinguished real-time or non-realtime traffic)

#### Datagram length
- total **length of the IP datagram** (header + data)
- measured by bites
- 16 bites long

#### Identifier, flags, fragmentation offset.
- new version IP, IPv6 does not allow for fragmentation

#### Time-to-live(TTL)
- ensure datagrams do not circulate forever in the net work
- Decremented by one each time
- processed by router
- Reach 0, router must drop datagram

#### Protocol
- used in IP datagram reach destination.
- The value indicate specific transport-layer protocol where data portion in IP datagram should be pass

#### Header checksum
- Helps router in detecting bit errors in received IP datagram
- each header checksum need to **recomputed again** at each router

Why does TCP/UP perform error checking at both the transport and network layers?

```text
- Only IP header is checksummed at the IP layers while TCP/UDP checksum is computed over the entire TCP/UDP segment
-  TCP/UDP and IP not necessarily both have to belong to same protocal stack
```

#### Source and destination IP addresses
- insert IP address into source IP address

#### Options
- allow an IP header to be extended

#### Data(Payload)
- IP datagram contains the transport-layer segment tobe del,ivered to the destination
- Also can carry other data like ICMP messages

### IPv4 addressing

**Interface**

- **Boundary** between the *host* and the *physical link* is called **interface**.
